# Pure Next.js Static App - Redirects for client-side routing
# Cloudflare Pages _redirects file

# Redirect non-canonical /company (without slug) to search
/company /search 301
/company/ /search 301

# Note: Invalid URL patterns (like /contact?subject=*, /companies/q?*) are handled
# by the middleware which will return 404 and log the error.
# Cloudflare Pages doesn't support 404 status codes in redirect rules.

# Rewrite cariversity routes to index.html for client-side routing
# 200 = rewrite (not redirect), URL stays the same
